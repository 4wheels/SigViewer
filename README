1. Building SigViewer
---------------------

SigViewer depends on the following external libraries:

- Qt4
  http://qt-project.org/
- libbiosig
  http://biosig.sourceforge.net/

General instructions:

1. Install Qt4 development packages

2. Download the "external" archive for your platform from http://sigviewer.sourceforge.net/

3. Extract the "external" archive into SigViewer's source folder (the folder where "sigviewer.pro" is located)

4. Use qmake to generate a Makefile and call make:
   qmake sigviewer.pro && make

The SigViewer binary can be found in the "bin" directory (release or debug subfolders)



2. Deploying SigViewer
----------------------

Debian/Ubuntu:
  1. Build SigViewer

  2. Run the script "build-deb.sh", which generates a .deb package:
     ./build-deb.sh
